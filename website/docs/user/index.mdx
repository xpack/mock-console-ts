# How to use the xPack Mock Console

This section is intended for those who plan to use this module in their
own projects.

The `@xpack/mock-console` module can be imported into both TypeScript
and JavaScript Node.js code.

In TypeScript and ECMAScript modules, use `import`:

```typescript
import { MockConsole } from '@xpack/mock-console'
```

In JavaScript with CommonJS, use `require()`:

```javascript
const { MockConsole } = request('@xpack/mock-console')
```

The module can be included in any application and the class can be used
directly or a custom class can be derived from it for a custom behaviour.

The typical use case is to create an instance of the `Logger` object,
then log messages at different levels:

```javascript
const mockConsole = new MockConsole()

const log = new Logger({
  console: mockConsole,
  level: 'info'
})
```

The logged lines are available in the `outLines` and
`errLines` public members:

```javascript
t.ok(mockConsole.outLines.length > 0, 'has stdout')
t.match(mockConsole.outLines[1], 'Multiple subcommands', 'has title')

t.equal(mockConsole.errLines.length, 0, 'stderr is empty')
```

For debug purposes, there is also a function that can be used to display
string arrays with the lines prefixed by a line number; this is useful
in tests to decide what lines to check:

```javascript
import { dumpLines } from '@xpack/mock-console'

dumpLines(mockConsole.outLines)
```
